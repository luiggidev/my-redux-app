This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.


Refactored and compared an old counter I made using outdated Redux. Modern Redux does not use switch, case reducers, ACTION_TYPES or createStore.
